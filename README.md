# Image_Recognition-MLP
The first part of this notebook uses PySpark to build a Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP) for image recognition to predict whether a face is an 'old' person. In this assignment, i compared a logistic regression model and  three MLP models' performance: No hidden layers, One hidden Layer with 15 neurons, and Two Hidden Layers with 30 neurons each. The image pixels are used as features in the models, Logistic Regression was the highest performing with an AUC of about .89.  

The second part uses the infamous two-spirals dataset, a 2d classification dataset composed of two classes - each spiral representing one class. I compared a Logistic Regression model and an MLP for class prediction. The MLP model was the highest performing with an AUC of about .77.
